# About

This is the paper for the master course Principles of Object-Oriented Programming Languages at the VUB. The goal of this paper is to compare the object-oriented features of 2 object-oriented lanaguages. I have chosen C++ and Objective C.
The main goal of this repo is to collect the code snippets and examples that will be written for this paper, this could become a handy resource if I'm coding in Objective-C or C++ later. I decided to add the paper as well in case anybody is interested in reading it.
